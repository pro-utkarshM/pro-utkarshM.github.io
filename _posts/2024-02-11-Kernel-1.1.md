> Crafting Your Own Operating System: A Kernel Development Journey

Discovering the tricky trade of creating our own operating system by taking in my upcoming blogs on kernel development. From the basic Real Mode to the more complex worlds of Protected Mode, this practical journey covers a wide range of subjects essential to creating reliable operating systems.

> Real Mode Highlights:

### Legacy Real Mode Exploration
Exploring Intel's legacy Real Mode processors, which bring back memories of the 8086 era. Exploring the subtleties of memory management in this historical state and learn about the boot process.

### Hands-on Boot Loader Creation in Assembly
Experiencing the thrill of writing code in assembly language to craft your own boot loader. Witnessing the magic as our code is tested on a real machine, proudly displaying a simple "Hello World!" message on your screen.

### Introduction to Interrupts and Hard Disk Sector Reading
Navigate the world of interrupts in Real Mode and learn to read a sector from the hard disk. Lay the groundwork for future kernel development by gaining insights into these foundational concepts.

> Protected Mode Unveiled:

### Crafting a 32-Bit Multi-tasking Kernel
Elevating our skills as we transition to the advanced realm of protected mode development. Developing a 32-bit multi-tasking kernel, incorporating Intel's advanced memory protection features.

### Paging, Virtual Memory, and Memory Protection
Delving deep into the nuances of paging and virtual memory. Leverage Intel's memory protection features to safeguard your kernel and prevent user programs from causing harm.

### Building a FAT16 Filesystem Driver and Keyboard Drivers
Taking our kernel development to the next level by creating a FAT16 filesystem driver. Developing keyboard drivers to enhance user interaction within your operating system.

> Advanced Skills and Tools:

### ELF File Loader Implementation
Unlocking the power of ELF files as we implement an ELF file loader. Compiling our operating system programs into ELF files, allowing for the loading of binary or ELF programs.

### Debugging Disassembled Machine Code with GDB
Mastering the art of debugging as we dissect disassembled machine code. Utilize GDB to debug our kernel in an emulator, gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of our creation.

## What We'll Gain:

- A fully functioning 32-bit multi-tasking kernel.
- In-depth understanding of memory management concepts.
- The ability to load and run ELF files within your operating system.
- Proficiency in debugging techniques using tools like GDB.

## Prerequisites (If you want to follow):

- Proficiency in the C programming language.
- Basic knowledge of assembly language (recommended).
- Access to a Linux operating system, with Ubuntu being the recommended choice.
